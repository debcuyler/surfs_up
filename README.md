# Surfs Up
## Overview
W. Avy would like further analysis for the surf and ice cream business in Oahu. He is requesting that temperatures be evaluated for the months of June and December in order to determine if the new business is sustainable year round. 

## Results
Temperature analysis was completed for all temperatures recorded in the months of June and December and then summary statistics were calculated on each set of data
- June shows an average temperature of 74 degrees, with the minimum recorded temperature being 64 degrees and the maximum temperature recorded being 85 degrees
- December statistics show that the average temperature as being 71 degrees, which is slightly lower than June temperatures. The minimum temperature recorded was 56 degrees and the maximum temperature recorded was 83 degrees. 
- Although the temperatures are very close when comparing June and December, December is slightly cooler and may be just cool enough on many days that it would not be desireable to surf or eat ice cream. 

## Summary
Overall, I think the June and December temperatures are close enough that the business would be able to remain open year round. I would like to know some other variables to make a final decision. I would run a report that compared rainfall/precipitation for the two months as neither surfing nor ice cream is as desirable in the rain and if December is particularly rainy, it may be determined that the shop should not be open full time year round. The other data I would like to look at more closely would be the station data. I would compare the temperatures and precipitation recordings for the past year or two from the weather station closest to the proposed business location. This would give a more accurate picture of weather directly related to the business location.
